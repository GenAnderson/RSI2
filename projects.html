      <!-- -----------SCHOOLS HIDDEN SUMMARY--------------- -->
      <div class="hidden-project hidden-project__1">

          The project consists of 2 phases: 1) a new 15,200 square feet multi
          story high school classroom building, and 2) a renovation and
          expansion of the existing library and new senior pavilion. The new
          building consolidates science, art, and PE activities. The first level
          consists of 4 science laboratories and a prep office. The second level
          contains girls and boys locker / shower facilities, athletic support
          facilities and a large multi-purpose double classroom. The third level
          is dedicated to art with a general art room, digital art room, and
          supporting spaces. There also is an outdoor art deck, courtyard, and
          elevated walkway and view platform. The library expansion project
          totals 8,400 square feet in the existing Fleming Building. The
          existing structural members were strengthened, the previous lanai
          space was finished with a signature window façade and interior
          finishes, HVAC, and lighting. The senior courtyard provides a
          gathering space under a shade structure as well as on top on the green
          roof. The entire project has been certified LEED—Gold.
          <br />
          <br />
          During the pre-construction phase, RSI’s team met regularly with the
          design team, school staff, and other stakeholders to analyze design
          issues, flesh out unique site requirements, and agree on expectations.
          Careful coordination helped to expedite permitting, and construction,
          and a collaborative effort to provide VE solutions was valuable to
          keep the project within budget. A major concern was the effects
          construction would have on the busy and congested high school campus.
          RSI revised barricade plans, phasing, noisy work, and laydown areas to
          minimize the visual and noise nuisance. Construction procedures,
          scheduling and phasing plans were developed to minimize impact and
          ensure safety and well-being of the students, staff, and visitors.
          Additional offsite parking was utilized to minimize impact to the
          limited onsite parking.

          This project required the complete renovation of the 80-year old
          Kawananakoa Middle School Auditorium. The 14,000 square-feet building
          now holds a larger concert stage, updated highly technical theatrical
          lights & sound, new air-conditioning system, new auditorium seating,
          fixtures, windows, finishes, and new vinyl plank siding to mimic the
          original redwood siding. The concert hall seats 623 people, and the
          new “black box” lab-style theater seats 100. The project includes new
          second floor concrete mezzanine, control room, elevator, and scenic
          shop. RSI gutted the entire interior of the existing theater including
          the existing concrete slab-on-grade leaving the exterior and roofing
          intact. Extensive and careful excavation and site work was done within
          the existing framing for new structural footings, concrete SOG,
          risers, and mezzanine. Careful coordination was needed to rough-in all
          of the MEP, AV, and theatrical components.

          The Pacific Buddhist Academy (PBA) project consists of a new 2-story,
          12,000 SF CMU and steel building along Lusitana Street. This
          Design-Build Project took nearly 4 years for the initial concept and
          was the combined efforts of the Ralph S. Inouye, RIM Architects, and
          PBA. The project was accomplished through consistent communication
          between RSI, the architect, client, and affiliated parties, including
          the Honpa Hongwanji Hawaii Betsuin Temple and PBA’s partner, Hongwanji
          Mission School (HMS).
          <br />
          <br />
          The building is situated on a steep hill, on which the back of the
          building appears to be three stories tall. At the front of the
          building is a concrete amphitheater and a garden featuring both native
          and introduced species of plants, with landscaping wrapping around the
          sides. Master craftsmen were brought in to work on the gold-leafed
          Buddhist shrine and the traditional Japanese tea room, which has a
          sunken hearth built into the floor. Moreover, tradition and
          technological innovation come together in the building’s multipurpose
          room. In addition to housing the altar, the room features a foldable
          wall, which also functions as a white board, enabling the space to
          accommodate the need for classrooms as the school continues to grow.
          The room’s surround sound system and advanced lighting system are
          intended to be used for PBA performances. The tall glass windows near
          the entrance can also be folded to allow easy access to the room from
          the outside. For educational purposes, the designers called for an
          open ceiling to allow students to observe the inner workings of the
          building, while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing look.
          <br />
          <br />
          To make the most out of the educational opportunity, RSI took on a
          student from PBA as an intern. Aspiring to be an engineer, this
          experience gave her the chance to attain hands on experience, learn
          different aspects of the industry, and gain insight into what it means
          to be an engineer. For her, it has been one of the highlights of her
          high school experience, and she says she is very grateful for the
          chance to see her school being built from the ground up.

          The project involved a complete renovation of the 70-year-old
          Roosevelt High School Auditorium, reconstructing it up to modern
          standards, yet keeping the exterior structure intact due to its
          classification as a “historic” building. The new backstage building
          extension was added to house dressing rooms, classrooms, restrooms,
          and a rehearsal studio. It was constructed to match the existing
          finishes and replicates all the original decorative millwork,
          mouldings, windows and trims.
          <br />
          <br />
          The new facility accommodates over 700 guests and is equipped with a
          state-of-the art concert shell & acoustical system resulting in an
          awe-inspiring experience for performers and audiences alike. The
          project won an Award of Excellence in the 2008 GCA Build Hawaii
          awards.

      <div class="hidden-project hidden-project__5">
        <p>
          The First Hawaiian Bank, Manoa Branch project consisted of renovating
          an existing 3 story building and adding new 2 story wing to house
          First Hawaiian Bank’s Manoa branch as well as its leased office space.
          The new building consists of a combined reinforced concrete and steel
          structure with a metal roof, metal soffit panels and plaster siding.
          This new structure was attached to a 3 story existing CMU building,
          and the new space encompassed approximately 15,000 square feet. Other
          features included a 3 story elevator, 2 on grade parking areas, a 1 ½
          story entry curtain wall, and site and building retaining walls.
          Interior elements included an open branch space with a suspended wood
          ceiling, an ATM room, 2 teller pods, offices, conference rooms,
          restrooms, a break room, and a vault.

          <br />
          <br />

          The project site is nestled in an existing residential neighborhood.
          Thus, one of the challenges was demolishing existing homes and a wing
          of the existing building before building a new commercial building
          that fit within Manoa’s residential community. An additional challenge
          was coordinating with 2 mobile carriers to move the existing equipment
          housed on the existing building and site and phase the installation of
          new equipment while keeping the carriers in service. RSI helped to
          complete the project within the client’s budget by assisting in a
          significant value engineering exercise at the beginning of the project
          and adopting lean construction principles to execute the project on
          schedule. As part of the project delivery, RSI performed a 3D laser
          scan of the existing building and created a 3D Building Information
          Model (BIM). The model was used to perform clash detection sessions
          with the design team and subcontractors to coordinate MEP systems
          within the tight ceiling spaces before any conflicts arose in the
          field.

          This project includes the renovation of an aging 2-story, 11,220
          square foot building to turn it into the flagship branch of the
          Honolulu Federal Credit Union. Ushijima Architects’ use of stone,
          wood, and glass gives this “jewel” of Moiliili a fresh and modern
          look. The interior design incorporates “teller pods” instead of
          traditional teller lines to give credit union members a more personal
          banking experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          Substantial demolition of the existing exterior CMU and concrete
          stairwells, second floor walkway, and interior precast concrete tees
          and slabs were required and completed safely to install a new elevator
          shaft, stairwell, exterior windows, and awnings. Exterior improvements
          include new EIFS and porcelain tile cladding, dual glazed windows,
          aluminum trellis and sunshades, and silicon roofing. Interior
          improvements include all new drywall, acoustical, gyp, and wood slate
          ceilings, decorative acoustical wall paneling, solid surface millwork,
          glass partition walls and doors, luxury vinyl, carpet, ceramic and
          stone floorings, electrical, lighting, communication, fire alarm,
          security and AC systems for new restrooms, break room/kitchen, meeting
          spaces, vault, and executive offices. A polycarbonate skylight
          provides natural light to a central aluminum and glass staircase and
          creates a focal point and connection between the 1st and 2nd floors.

          RSI and our subcontractor team worked in partnership with the
          architect and owner to provide early budget pricing, VE ideas, and

          The Kapolei Village Center sits on 3.94 acres bordered by Kapolei
          Parkway, Wakea, Kuou, and Alohikea Streets. At the time of the
          project's completion, a 36,000 square foot Foodland Supermarket
          anchored the development of an additional 22,000 square feet of
          commercial space spread over five additional buildings. RSI worked
          diligently with Group 70 International and the owners to provide an
          acceptable design as well as a budget to move the project into
          construction.
          <br />
          <br />
          With sudden changes in the economic environment, the entire team
          needed to work together to develop an extensive list of
          value-engineering ideas to provide the necessary savings to make the
          project financial viable while still maintaining the necessary design
          elements to gain approval of the City. RSI worked closely with Group
          70’s team and provided timely pricing information to create a list of
          ideas that fulfilled the overall goal of budget and design.

        <p>
          Under the State’s Emergency Proclamation to build more affordable
          housing, Ralph S. Inouye Co., Ltd. (RSI) was selected by the City &
          Country to assist Group 70 International (G70) in the conversion of an
          existing school into a 42-unit rental complex. The building complex
          contains one 2-story building and one 3-story building. In order to
          fast track, the project design occurred concurrently with
          construction. This project was unique, as input came not only from the
          owners, but also the surrounding community. Being so close to
          neighboring houses and apartments, any complaints with noise or dust
          were addressed immediately.
          <br />
          <br />
          Construction included a full gut and renovation of the approximately
          20,000 square feet of space. Demolition included hazardous material
          abatement of some asbestos containing material. One, two, and three
          bedroom units were equipped with new electrical, plumbing, and fire
          sprinkler system. Interior work included new drywall, painting,
          windows, kitchen appliances, shower, and toilet accessories, as well
          as a laundry facility and 15 parking stalls, four of which are ADA
          compliant. Exterior work included concrete spall repairs, new
          guardrails, sun shades, a pedestrian traffic coating, and utilities
          feeding the building.
          <br />
          <br />
          RSI provided G70 with constructability reviews, value engineering
          ideas, cost estimating at different stages, and schedule feedback. By
          closely monitoring the overall schedule and constantly communicating
          with the design team, items that would normally cause delays were
          identified early on in the design phase, allowing for the expediting
          of long lead items which lead to the project’s on-time completion.
          Initial community concerns with the housing ceased once the finished
          product was revealed, with no complaints from the users or surrounding
          community.

          worked with G70 and the City to provide cost estimating, a
          constructability review, and VE ideas during pre-construction. RSI
          selected MEP subcontractors early on to work in collaboration with the
          design team to streamline the design, address long-lead material
          procurement, and control cost. Being in close proximity to neighboring
          houses and apartments, any complaints with noise or dust were
          addressed immediately.
          <br />
          <br />
          Construction included a complete gut and renovation of the 4-story
          9,800 SF building. Demolition included hazardous material abatement
          and a complete removal and replacement of the existing roofing system.
          Single and multiple occupant style dormitory units were equipped sinks
          and refrigerators, as well as a completely new electrical, plumbing,
          and fire sprinkler system. A new chairlift was installed on the
          exterior to provide access to ADA units on the second floor. Interior
          work included new drywall, painting, windows, luxury vinyl plank
          flooring, ceiling systems, and doors and hardware. The project also
          included laundry facilities, common restroom/showers, common kitchen
          and community spaces, offices, and storage. Exterior work included
          concrete spall repairs, new guardrails, sun shades, a pedestrian
          traffic coating, and utilities feeding the building. Improvements also
          included new site fencing, painting, railings, landscape and picnic
          spaces, and a decorative mural wall.

          The project consisted of a 3.2 acre housing development in Waianae,
          Oahu for Housing Solutions, a local developer that provides affordable
          housing. 50 units consisting of 2 bedroom and studio apartments, along
          with a recreations center, playground area, laundry facility, and
          management offices, were constructed. Work consisted of concrete
          slab-on-grade, wood framed construction with wood exterior siding and
          asphalt shingle roofing. Finishes included, stained concrete floors,
          VCT, Carpet, ceramic tile, painting, plastic laminated cabinets, light
          fixtures, and doors and vinyl windows.
          <br />
          <br />
          Housing Solutions utilizes government grants, private donations, and
          financing to develop projects. RSI worked with Housing Solutions to
          develop workable cashflow schedules, VE solutions, and overall project
          management to deliver the development on time and within budget,
          exceeding all quality expectations.

          The Kapolei Regional Park Skate Facility is a 7,000 square foot park
          with three of Hawaii’s first fully enclosed concrete bowls with
          Penrose pool coping. The park also consists of approximately 2,000
          square feet of “street” element such as grinder blocks, steps, ledges,
          and banks.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ralph S. Inouye Co., Ltd. took a unique approach to this design-build
          project by hosting design workshops where the general public and
          skating community were invited and participated in shaping the design
          of the park. This approach fostered a sense of ownership by all
          participants, evident in every weekend in which the park is filled
          with skaters of all ages and ability.

          The Animal Encounter Discovery Center at the Honolulu Zoo quadrupled
          the size of the Keiki Zoo and has many one-of-a-kind exhibits. The 1.5
          acre site was cleared and utility infrastructure was installed. The
          project included a unique fiberglass koi tank with a crawl-thru log
          and pop-up, interactive water wheel, goat interactive display, guinea
          pig display, and goose pond. A new entry building, story-telling
          garden, chicken, horse, cow, and llama sheds were designed and
          constructed with an old-Hawaiian style theme.
          <br />
          <br />
          During the pre-construction phase, RSI’s team met regularly with the
          design team, zoo staff, and city project managers to analyze design
          issues, flesh out unique zoo requirements, and agree on expectations.
          Careful coordination helped to expedite permitting and construction
          while minimizing change orders and delays. The special needs of the
          animals and zoo also were discussed and considered during these team
          meetings. Construction procedures, scheduling, and phasing plans were
          developed to minimize impact and ensure the safety and well-being of
          the animals, staff, and visitors. Zoo staff enjoyed hands-on input
          throughout the entire project, which helped RSI create designs and
          finishes best suited for the animals and general public. Due to the
          diligent work of the entire team during the pre-construction phase,
          the project was completed 10 months ahead of schedule and under
          budget. The zoo staff expressed satisfaction with the exhibits and
          enlarged areas for the animals, and the is now the most visited
          section of the zoo.
