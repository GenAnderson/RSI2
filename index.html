        <p>
          Ralph S. Inouye Co. Ltd., a Hawaii corporation, was founded in 1962.
          For decades we have played an integral role in the growth and
          development of Hawaii, working on a diverse range of commercial
          building, renovation, and engineering projects for Federal, State and
          City agencies, as well as private entities. Through our sustainability
          and good business practices, we have the capability of undertaking
          projects of various sizes with bonding capacity in excess of $100
          million per project.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The trusted Ralph S. Inouye name has become synonymous with quality,
          responsibility and integrity. For our clients, this means they will
          have a General Contractor who is attentive to their need, as well as
          the assurance that their project will be built according to sound
          construction methodology by skilled craftsmen. The end result is a
          lasting project, built to withstand the test of time. From the Rainbow
          Place Condominium erected in the 70’s to projects currently under
          construction, Ralph Inouye projects are a testament to the level of
          pride and detail we put into our work.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We believe the key to achieving a high level of quality and customer
          satisfaction is our employees and work experience. Our friendly work
          environment, as well as our well-established family values and
          culture, helps us to maintain a strong sense of loyalty and high
          employee retention. Our project managers, teamed with our veteran
          field crews, make a cohesive team whose goal is to complete projects

          <p>Ralph S. Inouye, 1915-2018</p>
          <p>
            Mr. Ralph Inouye founded Ralph S. Inouye Co., Ltd. (RSI) in 1962 and
            built up the company over several decades to become one of the
            leading contractors in the State of Hawaii. In addition to founding
            RSI, Mr. Inouye filled his extensive engineering career by serving
            as president of the General Contractors Association and building
            superintendent for the City and County of Honolulu. Mr. Inouye also
            generously contributed to non-profit organizations, such as the
            Junior Achievement of Hawaii, while becoming a well-respected figure
            in the local business community.
            <br />
            <br />
            Prior to founding RSI, Mr. Inouye came from a humble background and
            graduated from Leilehua High School in 1933. As the first from his
            family to attend college, Mr. Inouye earned an engineering degree
            from the University of Hawaii in 1937 and went on to earn a law
            degree from Boston College in 1950.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mr. Inouye passed away at age 103 in September 2018. The company
            remains under family leadership with Mr. Inouye's grandson, Blake
            Inouye, currently serving as President and CEO.

            Following his father's founding of Ralph S. Inouye in 1962, Lance
            joined the company in 1981 as an estimator. He then worked as RSI's
            chief estimator and vice president before becoming president and CEO
            in 2002. Prior to working at RSI, Lance was a nuclear engineer for
            the U.S. Navy and a deputy attorney general for the state of Hawaii.
            <br />
            <br />
            He has also served as the president and director of the General
            Contractors Association of Hawaii while supporting organizations
            such as Easter Seals Hawaii and the Hawaii Community Foundation. In
            2020, Lance was named the Outstanding Union Builder of the Year by
            the Hawaii Regional Council of Carpenters in recognition of his
            contributions to Hawaii's construction industry and the community.
            After heading the company as President and CEO for 22 years, Lance
            was succeeded by his son, Blake Inouye, in 2024, and continues to
            serve the company as Board Chairman.
